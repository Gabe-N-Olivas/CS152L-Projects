## Switch Statements

```java
int myNumber = 10;
switch (myNumber) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
        System.out.println("You got 1, 2, or 3")
        break;
    case 5:
        System.out.println("5")
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Some other number!")
}
```

Equivalent if statement
```java
if(myNumber == 1 || myNumber || == 2 || myNumber = 3) {
    System.out.println("You got 1, 2, or 3")
        } 
```

## The switch statement
* Test value of expression and jumps to location in the switch statement.
* Expression is limited to certain types
  * int, short, byte, char
  * String
  * Cannot be float or double
* Positions in switch are marked with case labels of the form case constant:, where constant is literal of
* default position allows to

## Break Statement in Switch
* The break makes the computer skip the rest of the switch statement
* If you leave it out the computer will just fall through to the next case

## New Switch Example
Forgetting the `break` statement is a common source of bugs. JDK 14 introduced a new style switch.
(Note the arrow instead of colon for cases)
```java
int myNumber = 10;
switch (myNumber) {
    case 1, 2, 3 -> {
        System.out.println("You got 1, 2, or 3");
    }
    case 5 -> System.out.println("You got 5")
    default -> {
        System.out.println("Some other number!")
    }
}
```
