## High Level View of a Program
There are two main parts of a program
* Instructions - What should the program do with the data?
* Data - Numbers, words, pictures, databases, etc.

## Data
* Variable - Named location in memory
* Type - the sort of data a variable can hold (int, double, String, etc.)
* Literal â€“ The actual hardcoded values typed in your code (42, 3.14159, "Hello World")

## Breaking down programs into smaller parts
*

## Advantages of methods
* It saves typing. Calling a method once is much shorter than duplicating the code over and over again
* It helps with organization. It's easier to understand what a task does when you have it seperated


## Additional Java Organization
In addition to methods Java has more high level ways to group code
* Class - A class contains variables and methods related to each other.
  * Some classes are built into Java such as Math, string, system, etc.
* Packages - This organizes classes in a directory structure

## Expressions and operators

## Using Expressions
The value of an expression can be used to:
* Assign to variables
* Use as a parameter to method call
* Combine it with other values into more complicated expressions

## Operators
```java 
int x = 5;
int y = 2;

int sum = x + y;         // addition, returns 7
int diff = x - y;      // subtraction, returns 3
int mult = x * y;      // multiplication, returns 10
int div = x / y;       // division, returns 2 (Because the data type is int)
int remainder = x % y;  // modulus aka remainder, returns 1 

```

## Rational operators
```java
int A = 1;
int B = 2;

A == B;     // Is A equal to B
A != B;     // Is A NOT equal to B
A > B;      // Is A greater than B
A < B;      // Is A less than B
A <= B;     // Is A greater than OR equal to B
A >= B;     // Is A less than OR equal to B
```

## Boolean Operators
```java
A = True
B = False
A && B  // AND, Are both A and B true? Returns False
A || B  // OR, Is A or B True, Returns True
!A      // NOT, Negate the value of A, Returns False
```
