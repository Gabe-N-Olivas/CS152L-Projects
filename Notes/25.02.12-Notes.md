## Strings and Char
Strings (class) are included in the java.lang package. Examples of a string would be:
```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s1 = "H";
String s3 = "";
```
chars are a primitive type which store a single character. Unlike Strings chars must be defined with a single quotes `''`
```java
char c = 'H';       //  Valid
char c = 'Hello';   // Not Valid
char c = '';        // Not Valid
char c = "H";        // Not Valid
```
## String Concatenation
```java
String a = "Hello";
String b = "World";

String c = a + b;

System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
System.out.println(c);
```
`Output`
```
Hello
World
HelloWorld
```

## + Operator Order
the + operator follows the president of the first operation in a line for example an `int + int` would result in a math operation while a `String + int + int` would result in a String concatenation across
```java
int a = 3;
int b = 7;
System.out.println(a+b);
System.out.println("Sum is" + a + b);
System.out.println("Sum is" + (a + b));
System.out.println(a + b + " is the sum");
```
`Output`
```
10
Sum is 37
Sum is 10
12 is the sum
```
