# February 3rd 2025 Notes

## While and If
* Branching - If/else statements
* Loops - use while

## While Loops
```java
while (boolExpr){
    // What to repeat while boolExpr is true
        }
```
Make sure that loop conditions eventually become false so your program doesn't repeat infinitely

## Counting with a loop
```java
int number = 1;
while (number < 6) {
    System.out.println(number)
    number++ // Remember ++ adds one to variable
        }
```

## While and If together
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
if (i % 2 == 0) {
System.out.println(i + " is even");
    } else {
        System.out.println(i + " is odd");
    }
    ++i;
}
```

## While and IF
* Branching - use if/else
* Loops - While
* In theory these are all the commands you need

## Do while
Sometimes it's more convenient continuation condition at the end instead of the beginning
```java
do {
    // Body of loop
        } while (boolExpr);
```

## while vs do while
```java
do {
    loopBody
} while (testExpr);
```
is the same as
```java
loopbody
while (textexpr) {
    loopbody
        }
```

## Breaking out of Loops
Sometimes you will need to break out of a loop in the middle of it

`break;` allows you to do this

`continue;` works similarly but instead of escaping the loop it goes back to the beginning of the loop
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    // outputs 1,2,3,10
        if (i <= 3) {
            System.out.println(i)
        } else {
            continue;
                }
        i++
        }
System.out.println(i)
```

## for loops
We can use a for loop to combine initialization, continuation testing, and updating all in one line
