## Control Structures
* A sequence of instructions with no choices is not complicated
* Complex behavior is created with control structures
  * Branches - Choose a path based on a series of tests
  * Loop - Repeat a sequence of instruction

## Branch with if
```java
if (booleanExpr){ // Boolean Expresions can be a simple True, an inequallity, or comparitive
    // Some statement if true
        } else {
    // Some statement if false
}
```
## Omitting else
* You can omit else from an if statement, if you don't need the program to do anything if your statement is false
```java
int x = 5;

if (x == 5) {
    System.out.println("Yippe!")
}
```
